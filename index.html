									<h4>MyFICO</h4>

									<p>Understanding and keeping track of credit score is vital for everybody. MyFICO offers many ways to stay current on their credit score across all three credit bureaus. However, the member site hasn't been updated for responsive devices and was often confusing to customers.</p>

									<p>I was tasked to help redesign and connect the new interface with the backend API that was written in Java. The update took approximately 2-3 months to complete and has already made a huge positive impact which has brought up new registrations and overall kept existing customers coming back regularly. </p>

									<h4>Homestead</h4>

									<p>My role for Homestead consisted of working with the web developer team to manage the main homepage which was powered by Drupal. I would utilize Masonry Javascript framework and jQuery to provide a rich user experience. </p>

									<p>I was also assigned to help with their self-building website tool. The service, Site Expresso, provided functionality to build a unique template which was dependent on the changes in layout, style, and color. This meant that consistency for the backend code was most important. I led the team in making scaling templates possible by providing the framework which used SASS to compile with Java. The changes needed to happen in real time to the user. This meant that all the combined CSS files had to be generated for each update. The use of SASS made this an easy task. </p>

									<h4>Intuit</h4>

									<p>My primary role was developing prototypes for the Site Builder tool. However, there was a growing need for consistency for new and existing styles. To help simplify the process while avoiding recoding existing UI elements, I developed a pattern library for designers and programmers on the team to use. </p>

									<p>The pattern library was built with Wordpress as the backend tool and custom pages which had one section for the designers to upload mockups and wireframes. The other section was code that programmers can easily copy and paste into their projects. This cut down on production time, helped ensure easy updates, and provided reliable quick access with effeciency.</p>

									<h4>JustJennette</h4>

									<p>JustJennette is a fansite dedicated to the Nickelodeon celebrity actress Jennette McCurdy. Since it's debut in June 2010, JustJennette has been the most successful personal project to date. Under the hood, the custom layout was built for the Wordpress framework and optimized for responsive design with the aim of designing for mobile first. It is also utilizing Grunt for minification of object oriented Javascript/jQuery and SCSS compiling. </p>
